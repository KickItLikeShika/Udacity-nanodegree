Overview
In this project, the student had to make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
The student had to write code to (a) import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics, and (b) write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

The developed CLI program allows the user to explore an US bikeshare system database and retrieve statistics information from the database. The user is able filter the information by city, month and weekday, in order to visualize statistics information related to a specific subset of data. The user is also able to chose to view raw data and to sort this data by columns, in ascending or descending order.

# Description
This project is part of my Udacity's Nanodegree: Programming for Data Science.
The goal of this project is to compute descriptive statistics to gain insights of bike share data of three U.S cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. An interactive experience in the terminal will be provided as we run this Python script. The program would allow users to select the city, month and day of interest for calculating descriptive statistics. Popular times of travel, most popular stations and average trip durations etc will be calculated and revealed. An option to display original data is also provided.

# Files used
Following files are containing necessary code: bikeshare.py

Following files are not uploded to the remote repo (by using .gitignore) because the file size is too big: chicago.csv washington.csv new_york_city.csv
