# Udacity-nanodegree
Overview
In this project, the student had to make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
The student had to write code to (a) import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics, and (b) write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

The developed CLI program allows the user to explore an US bikeshare system database and retrieve statistics information from the database. The user is able filter the information by city, month and weekday, in order to visualize statistics information related to a specific subset of data. The user is also able to chose to view raw data and to sort this data by columns, in ascending or descending order.

# Project Title
Project 3: "Post your work on GitHub"

# Description
This project is the 3rd project of Udacity's Nanodegree "Programming for Data Science". The project is to show that work with a local and rempote repository is familiar. Several branches will be created and merged. The code file which is content of this repo is taken from Project 2 "Explore US bike share data" from the same Udacity Nanodegree and allows to analyse bike share data from 3 different US cities in order to calculate statistics depending on city, month and day of week.

# Files used
Following files are containing necessary code: bikeshare.py

Following files are not uploded to the remote repo (by using .gitignore) because the file size is too big: chicago.csv washington.csv new_york_city.csv
